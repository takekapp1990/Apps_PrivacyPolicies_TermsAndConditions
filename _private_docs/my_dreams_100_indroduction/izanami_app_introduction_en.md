# "My Dreams 100" - An App to Write Down 100 Dreams and Transform Your Life

## App Overview

**My Dreams 100** is an app that helps you write down and manage 100 things you want to do, clarifying your life's direction and supporting the realization of your dreams.

Many people have vague desires but find it surprisingly difficult to write them down concretely. Once they do write them down, they often forget about them after a few weeks, or the notes themselves get lost somewhere.

This app solves these challenges and serves as a tool to make your life more fulfilling.

## Why is it good to write down what you want to do?

Writing down what you want to do has several benefits:

### 1. Your life's direction becomes clear
It solves the problem of living each day vaguely and helps you grasp the opportunity to make every day exciting and turn your life around.

### 2. Your true self becomes visible
In the process of writing down 100 things you want to do, you begin to see what you truly want to do.

### 3. Motivation naturally arises
Having concrete goals changes your daily small choices, and your motivation naturally increases.

### 4. Life satisfaction improves
Having goals increases opportunities to experience a sense of achievement, improving overall life satisfaction.

## Common Challenges People Face

### Not knowing what to write
They get stuck after about 10 items and find it difficult to reach 100.

### Thoughts become scattered across different genres
Even after writing them down, they can't organize them and can't visualize taking action.

### Unable to manage and review after writing
They become satisfied just by writing and can't look back later or manage achievements.

### Motivation to continue doesn't last
Even though they're motivated at first, they tend to forget due to daily busyness.

## Developer's Vision

The inspiration for creating this app came from my own experience of having vague "things I want to do" but being unable to write them down concretely or manage them.

I thought many people might have similar challenges and wanted to create an app to solve them.

The number 100 might seem like a lot at first, but in the process of writing them down, you begin to see what you truly want to do. And by managing them, I believe life becomes more fulfilling.
